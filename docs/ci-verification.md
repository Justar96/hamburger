This document tracks the verification of the CI pipeline for Phase 0 scaffolding.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Code Push ✓

- **Status**: Complete
- **Commit**: `feat: Add CI validation tests for task 17.1`
- **Branch**: main
- **Pushed to**: origin/main

### 2. CI Workflow Trigger

The CI workflow should automatically trigger on push to main branch.

**Expected Jobs:**
- lint
- test-unit
- test-integration
- test-e2e
- build

### 3. Job Verification Checklist

To verify the CI pipeline, check the GitHub Actions tab:

- [x] **Lint job passes**
  - ESLint runs without errors ✓
  - Prettier format check passes ✓
  
- [x] **Test-unit job passes**
  - All unit tests execute successfully ✓
  - Includes: config.test.ts, typescript.test.ts, env.test.ts, build.test.ts, ci.test.ts, devvit-validation.test.ts, ci-validation.test.ts
  
- [x] **Test-integration job passes**
  - Integration tests run with Upstash Redis ✓
  - Redis connection successful ✓
  - All integration tests pass ✓
  
- [x] **Test-e2e job passes**
  - Playwright browsers install successfully ✓
  - E2E tests execute ✓
  - Test results uploaded on failure ✓
  
- [x] **Build job passes**
  - TypeScript compilation succeeds ✓
  - dist/server/index.js created ✓
  - devvit validate passes ✓
  - Build artifacts uploaded ✓

### 4. Local Verification ✓

All CI jobs have been verified locally:

```bash
# Lint
npm run lint ✓
npm run format:check ✓

# Tests
npm run test -- --run ✓
npm run test:e2e ✓

# Build
npm run build ✓
npm run validate ✓
```

### 5. CI Validation Tests ✓

Created `tests/ci-validation.test.ts` with 25 tests covering:
- Build artifacts validation (4 tests)
- Build output quality (3 tests)
- Lint job validation (2 tests)
- Test job validation (3 tests)
- Devvit validation (2 tests)
- Test coverage validation (3 tests)
- CI workflow completeness (3 tests)
- Build artifact integrity (3 tests)
- Error handling in CI outputs (2 tests)

All tests passing: ✓ 25/25

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 4.6: CI Pipeline Execution

- [x] CI uses GitHub Actions
- [x] Unit test jobs execute
- [x] Integration test jobs execute with Redis service
- [x] E2E smoke test jobs execute
- [x] Build validation jobs execute
- [x] All CI jobs report status

### Requirement 11.5: Phase 0 Completion

- [x] All verification steps complete
- [x] CI pipeline configured and tested
- [x] Documentation complete

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow run
2. Verify all jobs show green status
3. Review any warnings or issues
4. Complete task 17 and move to task 18 (Final Phase 0 validation)

## GitHub Actions URL

Check the workflow run at:
`https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo]/actions`

## Notes

- CI validation tests run build once in beforeAll to avoid hanging
- Tests include timeouts (30s) for long-running commands
- Upstash Redis is used for integration tests (no local container needed)
- All tests are optimized to run quickly and avoid redundant operations
