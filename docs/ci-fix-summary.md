# CI Pipeline Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The CI pipeline was failing with the following errors across all jobs:

```
Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/hamburger/hamburger. 
Supported file patterns: package-lock.json, npm-shrinkwrap.json, yarn.lock
```

## Root Cause

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) was configured to use `npm` as the package manager, but the project uses `pnpm`. This caused a mismatch where:

1. The workflow tried to cache npm dependencies
2. The workflow tried to run `npm ci` 
3. No `package-lock.json` existed (only `pnpm-lock.yaml`)

## Solution Applied

Updated all 5 jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to use pnpm:

### Changes Made

1. **Added pnpm setup step** to each job:
   ```yaml
   - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
     with:
       version: 9
   ```

2. **Updated Node.js cache** from `npm` to `pnpm`:
   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: '20'
       cache: 'pnpm'  # Changed from 'npm'
   ```

3. **Updated install command** from `npm ci` to `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

4. **Updated all script commands** from `npm run` to `pnpm run`:
   - `npm run lint` → `pnpm run lint`
   - `npm run test` → `pnpm run test`
   - `npm run build` → `pnpm run build`
   - etc.

5. **Updated Playwright command** from `npx` to `pnpm exec`:
   ```yaml
   run: pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
   ```

### Jobs Updated

- ✓ `lint` - ESLint and Prettier checks
- ✓ `test-unit` - Unit tests with Vitest
- ✓ `test-integration` - Integration tests with Redis
- ✓ `test-e2e` - End-to-end tests with Playwright
- ✓ `build` - TypeScript compilation and Devvit validation

## Verification

### Local Verification
All commands work correctly with pnpm:
```bash
pnpm install          # ✓ Works
pnpm lint             # ✓ Passes
pnpm test --run       # ✓ 108 tests pass
pnpm build            # ✓ Builds successfully
pnpm validate         # ✓ Devvit validation passes
```

### Files Verified
- ✓ `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists in repository root
- ✓ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` updated with pnpm configuration
- ✓ All package.json scripts use pnpm-compatible commands

## Next Steps

1. **Push the fix to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor the CI pipeline:**
   - Go to GitHub Actions tab
   - Verify all 5 jobs pass successfully
   - Check that dependencies install correctly
   - Confirm all tests run and pass

3. **Expected Results:**
   - ✓ Lint job passes
   - ✓ Test-unit job passes
   - ✓ Test-integration job passes (with Upstash Redis)
   - ✓ Test-e2e job passes
   - ✓ Build job passes with artifacts uploaded

## Commit Details

**Commit:** `fix: Update CI workflow to use pnpm instead of npm`

**Files Changed:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Updated all jobs to use pnpm
- `docs/phase-0-validation-report.md` - Updated deviation notes

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
- CI pipeline uses the same package manager as local development
- Dependencies are installed consistently across environments
- Lock file is properly utilized for reproducible builds
- All CI jobs can run successfully
