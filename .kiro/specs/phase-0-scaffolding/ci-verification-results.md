## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 4.6
✅ CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions
- All 5 jobs defined and tested
- Proper triggers configured
- Artifact upload configured

### Requirement 11.5
✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## Next Steps

To trigger the CI pipeline on GitHub:

1. **Commit and push changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add CI validation tests and verify pipeline"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor GitHub Actions:**
   - Navigate to repository → Actions tab
   - Verify all 5 jobs show green status
   - Check job logs for any warnings

3. **Required GitHub Secrets:**
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` - For integration tests (if not already set)
